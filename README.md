# Brief Overview

My name is Emilio Moya, and during the summer of 2019, I aided in research conducted at the University of Michigan. Specifically, I worked in the Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences(NERS) department and was tasked with creating Python programs that processed previously collected neutron and photon data.
